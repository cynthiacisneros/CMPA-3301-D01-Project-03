####  Project Name: **Website for Melon Heart Photography** 
Risks: 
- My technical skills could delay building the site.
- Working on this project alone feels overwhelming. 
- I work a full time job and have a child, possibly hindering the time I need to work on this project. 
- I have the habit of over-analyzing everything. 
- I'm completing work on another course at the same time this project is due, also affecting my time management. 

Using the TAME framework, I've created strategies to handle these risks. 
1. I've accepted that both feeling overwhelmed and over-analyzing are inevitable, but with the right support, I will be able to regulate my emotions to complete this assingment. 
2. By having avaliable child care after my work days this week, I've transfered the risk of my time constraints. 
3. I completed my final assisgnment for another course yesterday, mitigating the impact it would have on my project avaliability for this course. 

#### Work Breakdown Schedule 
1. A map outlining the pages of my website, such as my, "behind the lens," introdcution, photo gallery, and booking contact information to ensure a clear workflow. 
2. Creating the website prorotype with HTML and CSS, with two pages of content. 
3. Ensuring the website is live and public, and that all my required documents are uploaded to my repository.
