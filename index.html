<p> Hey there! My name is Cynthia and I'm so glad you are here! I'm a photographer based out McAllen, Texas, specializing in children's photography. I'm a mom to my lovely four year old daughter, and my love for photography began when I started taking her yearly birthday photos. I enjoy any and all sweets, bright colors, and genuine joy and laughter. Capturing candid moments brings me so much joy. I hope to be given the opportunity to capture sweet moments with your little ones. I hope to meet you soon! <p>
<h5> Portfolio</h5>
<p> My portfolio showcases my love for candid and authentic photography. Every image shows a peek of life - unscripted and full of emotion. These moments create lasting memories that you will cherish forever. <p>
