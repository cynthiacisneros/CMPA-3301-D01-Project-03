</p>Hey there! My name is Cynthia and I'm so glad you are here! I'm a photographer based out McAllen, Texas, specializing in children's photography. I'm a mom to my lovely four year old daughter, and my love for photography began when I started taking her yearly birthday photos. I enjoy any and all sweets, bright colors, and genuine joy and laughter. Capturing candid moments brings me so much joy. I hope to be given the opportunity to capture sweet moments with your little ones. I hope to meet you soon!</p>
