## Melon Heart Photography 
1.  The purpose of my project proposal is to build a website for my small business, **Melon Heart Photography**. It would be a portfolio and booking platform designed to showcase children's photography with spontanuity and authenticity. This project was created to provide parents with an accessible way to view my work and schedule a photography session with me. My site aims to build trust with my customers and provide clear instructions for their booking experience.
